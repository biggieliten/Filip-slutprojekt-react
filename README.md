# React Slutproject - Book Search 2000

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- This is my exam project for the React course.
- It's an application based on OpenLibrary's API where you can search for books, mark them as favorites or read. But also rate and review them.
